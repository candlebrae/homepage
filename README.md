# A Simple Homepage

This is my current custom homepage, designed to be easily changed between different color palettes. It features four columns of links to make it simple to categorize your most visited sites, as well as a search bar (currently queries DuckDuckGo, but you can change this if you prefer a different engine) and full keyboard controls if you'd prefer not to touch your mouse.

Defaults (all customizable in colors.cfg):

  - Color scheme: [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
  - Font: Source Code Pro Medium
