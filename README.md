# A Simple Homepage

![A screenshot of the homepage, with a search bar centered on the screen and four columns of links below it.](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/409030626/081d2615-8731-4310-8615-61b6b0be5284)

This is a simple and functional homepage, designed to be easily changed between different color palettes. It features four columns of links to make it simple to categorize your most visited sites, as well as a search bar that queries a search engine of your choice (default is DuckDuckGo). It should resize nicely to fit the size of your browser window. It's also capable of being navigated using only your keyboard. Upon opening the page, the search bar is focused, making it easy to search and go.

To change the search engine or links, edit homepage.html. To change the colors and font, edit colors.cfg.

**Defaults:**

  - Color scheme: [Gruvbox Dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
  - Font: Source Code Pro Medium
  - Search engine: DuckDuckGo
