# A Simple Homepage

![A screenshot of the homepage, with a search bar centered on the screen and four columns of links below it.](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/409030626/081d2615-8731-4310-8615-61b6b0be5284)

This is my current custom homepage, designed to be easily changed between different color palettes. It features four columns of links to make it simple to categorize your most visited sites, as well as a search bar (currently queries DuckDuckGo, but you can change this if you prefer a different engine) and full keyboard controls if you'd prefer not to touch your mouse. It should resize nicely to fit the size of your browser window.

**Defaults (all customizable in colors.cfg except for the search engine):**

  - Color scheme: [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
  - Font: Source Code Pro Medium
  - Search engine: DuckDuckGo
